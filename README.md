# DETECTION-OF-FACE-MASK
Face mask detection refers to detect whether a person is wearing a mask or not.
In fact, the problem is reverse engineering of face detection where the face is detected using different machine learning algorithms for the purpose of security, authentication and surveillance. 
Face detection is a key area in the field of Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition.
A significant body of research has contributed sophisticated to algorithms for face detection in past. 
The primary research on face detection was done in 2001 using the design of handcraft feature and application of traditional machine learning algorithms to train effective classifiers for detection and recognitionÂ .
The major contribution of the proposed work is given below Develop a novel object detection method that combines one-stage and two-stage detectors for accurately detecting the object in real-time from video streams with transfer learning at the back end.
Improved affine transformation is developed to crop the facial areas from uncontrolled real-time images having differences in face size, orientation and background. 
This step helps in better localizing the person who is violating the facemask norms in public areas/ offices. 
Creation of unbiased facemask dataset with imbalance ratio equals to nearly one. 
The proposed model requires less memory, making it easily deployable for embedded devices used for surveillance purposes.
